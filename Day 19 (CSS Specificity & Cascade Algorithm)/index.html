      Hello I am Learning CSS Specificity & Cascade Today
    </h1>

    <!--! here we have made an inline style therefor it will be the highest in the specifity -->

    <div>
      <h3>The Cascade Algorithm</h3>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for
        solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.
        It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS
        will be purple.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser
        resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct
        stages.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Position and order of appearance:</strong> The order in which
          your CSS rules appear
        </li>
        <p class="note">The last position will be applicable</p>
        <li>
          <strong>Specificity:</strong> An algorithm that determines which CSS
          selector has the strongest match
        </li>
        <p class="note">
          The order of specificity is: Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or
          Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector
          <p class="important"><strong>So come from backward in terms of using specificity this will help to overwrite if it needed</strong></p>
        </p>
        <li>
          <strong>Origin:</strong> The order in which CSS appears and where it
          comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser
          extension, or your authored CSS
        </li>
        <p class="note">
            If we don't add any style for a particular portion of our code browser will give them attribute as default but if we add our own than browser's will be overwritten by our style 
        </p>
        
        <img src="./image.png" alt="learning specifity in css">


        <li>
          <strong>Importance:</strong> Some CSS rules are weighted more heavily
          than others, especially with the !important rule type Lets look into
          all these one by one
        </li>

        <p class="note">There is an option even if we made a inline style it can be changed which is using !important after the attribute for example..... <strong>color: red !important</strong></p>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 data-x="a">Learning About the Attribute Selector</h3>

        <p class="try-imp" style="background-color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 500;">
            data-x="something" is called Attribute Selector of a particular portion in terms of specificity it is same as Class............By the way this is an inline style css tag so we will be using importance on this portion. Without the importance rule now it's background-color is yellow green we will make it orangered!!!.........so now it is orangered because in css code we have make <strong>background-color: orangered !important</strong>
        </p>
