    <!--! just activate the upper comment part we will see what is doing inline element explanation is right below  -->

    <!--!  why there is a gap in this two div i have set it as margin: o still why?  -->
    <!-- * Inline elements respect spaces, newlines, and tabs in the HTML code, which creates a small gap.Your HTML has a space or newline between <div class="box"> and <div class="box2">, causing the gap. -->

    <!-- so we must remeber it that inline element respects a little gap tab or new line they create a space so we will write the code as...... -->

    <div class="box box1">I am a box</div>
    <div class="box">I am another box</div>
    <!-- ! Now we don't see the gap -->
