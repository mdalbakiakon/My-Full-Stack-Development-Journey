    <h1>Core Web Vitals</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</h2>
    <p>The amount of time to render the largest content element visible in the viewport, from when the user requests the URL. <strong>It means the largest picture or image or video portion which is the largest section of the page, when a user use our website and the pages largest amount takes how much time to load.</strong></p>
    <h2>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</h2>
    <p>CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire loading of a page.<strong>We must remember that if we add any image we should give a width or height of it so the browser knows before the size of our picture and it doesnt take much time to load then when the size is unknown it takes time and it may fall in CLS.</strong></p>
    <h2>FID (First Input Delay)</h2>
    <p>FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.</p>
    <section class="warning"><p><strong>Warning!!!</strong> First Input Delay (FID) is no longer a Core Web Vital, and has been replaced by the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric. As a consequence, support for FID ended on September 9, 2024. You should now focus on INP.</section></p>

    <h2>INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</h2>
    <p>INP is part of Core Web Vitals Metrics and measures a page’s overall responsiveness by tracking the latency of all clicks, taps, and keyboard interactions during a user’s entire visit. The final INP score reflects the longest interaction delay, excluding outliers.</p>
