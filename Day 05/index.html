    <p>For Example</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>This is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. HTML, or “HyperText Markup Language,” has been around in some form since roughly 1993, when it was created by physicist Tim Berners-Lee. It’s now in its fifth generation, HTML5. HTML isn’t a programming language, rather it’s a “Markup language.” It uses a syntax of tags to change the way text is displayed, for instance. It can also define where images go on a page.</dd>

        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>CSS or “Cascading Style Sheets” works with HTML to create the format for web pages. It works on top of the foundation of a page that was created with HTML. It also helps adapt pages to different formats optimized for desktops or mobile devices. The latest standard is CSS3, meaning they are in their third generation.</dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript, which is often abbreviated to JS, is another front-end programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries like JQuery. Whereas HTML & CSS are used to control presentation, formatting, and layout, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different web elements. </dd>
